# About Dialog

A simple about dialog node for the Godot game engine.
After importing, simply add a AboutDialog node in the editor.
Automatically displays the projects name, version and description as put in the ProjectSettings, although this can all be overridden.
The advanced settings allow for the format of the title and body of the dialog to be configured.

This plugin (AboutDialog) consists effectively of a single script, it's icon, an example, and some supporting documentation, making it a simple solution for a test dialog, and for more dialog heavy games.
