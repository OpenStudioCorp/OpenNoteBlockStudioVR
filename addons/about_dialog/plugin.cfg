name="About Dialog"
description="A simple about dialog node for the Godot game engine.

After importing, simply add a AboutDialog node in the editor and otherwise treat it like a normal AcceptDialog.

Automatically displays the projects name, version and description as put in the project settings, although this can all be overridden.

The advanced settings allow for the format of the title and body of the dialog to be configured."
