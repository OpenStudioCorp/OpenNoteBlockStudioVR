# OpenNoteBlockStudioVR! 

Welcome to the official Development repository for OpenNoteBlockStudioVR!

This was made using the Godot 4.2 engine, and is a VR port of the original OpenNoteBlockStudio.

This game/VR Software uses the godot 4.2 XR template as it's base.

OpenNoteBlockStudioVR Introduces you into the world of VR Music with it's interactive creation system. 

You can create your own music, and play it back in VR, and even share it with others!

If you want to take on some challenges, just ask jason the cat for some challenges, and he will give you some to do!

This game is still in development, and is not yet ready for a full release, but you can still play it and have fun with it!

hopefully there will be some development builds released soon, so you can try it out!

there could even be a interactive story??????? who knows!
